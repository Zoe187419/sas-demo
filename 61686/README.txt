amateurs (us) for illustration purposes only and are not included in the file download.


The CSS files used in the book were also created for illustration purposes only and 
are not included in the file download. It is likely that our CSS files would not comply 
with your company's CSS policy, because they contain only a few simple CSS selectors 
and are not designed to be integrated into a Web site.

 
If you are going to use JavaScript or CSS technology with ODS, you should look 
outside our book for direction about the proper JavaScript and CSS coding methods.

 
The program files are:


final_allpgms.sas - all the SAS 9.2 code used for screenshots in the book

final_allpgms_913_rev.sas - all the SAS 9.1.3 specific PROC TEMPLATE 
                            code (without the CLASS statement or other 9.2 template
                            enhancements). There are some template examples that
                            were not possible to convert to SAS 9.1.3 syntax. 
                            Those figure numbers are noted in a comment at the
                            top of this file.
