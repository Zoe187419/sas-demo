Accessing the Code and Data for This Book
The sample code and data for PROC DOCUMENT by Example Using SAS is 
available in a ZIP file from the link below. Note the following:

"documentToSas_v2.sas" - this file contains all of the numbered SAS 
programs that are included in the book.

"air.sas7bdat" - this file is the data set for users who do not 
already have the SASHELP.AIR data set.

"bydocument.sas" - this file creates the documents used in the book, 
(mylib.firstdoc,mylib.quickstart) and a few others.  While it is 
intended to be the same as the documents built in "documentToSas_v2.sas," 
this code builds only the documents, without the labels, titles, etc. 
You can then use these documents as a starting point for your own
exploration of the statements introduced in the book.

All three files are located here:
 http://support.sas.com/publishing/bbu/zip/63031.zip

Copy all of the files to a folder on your hard drive.
