This page contains the SAS code and full-color sample output
for all the examples in the book "SAS/GRAPH - Beyond the Basics".

All of the SAS jobs are named the same as the Example number
(such as example01.sas), and most of the output is also named
the same (except for the example03, where controlling the
name of the SAS output is one of the things being demonstrated
in the example).

Most of these SAS jobs contain the data in the SAS code, but
a few of the examples read the data from an external file
(.xlsx, .csv, etc).  In those cases, that external file is
in this same folder.  Similarly, a few of the examples reference
an image file (jpg, png, etc) - those image files are also 
located in this same folder.

All these jobs are set up to use the "current working directory"
to read the input, and write the output.  You can modify the 
SAS jobs to change that, if needed.       

You should be able to save these SAS jobs (and associated files)
to your hard drive, and then run them to produce the graphs
(with the exception of Example 22, which requires a SAS/Intrnet
server).
