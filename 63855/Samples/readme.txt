
Sample graphs

Sample graph code for some of the industry specific graphs from Chapters 12 and 13 are included 
in this package.  These graphs generally require specific data, and some processing to get set 
up the data in the right format for the graph.  Where necessary, the data creation is 
included in the program itself, so there is no dependency on any external data sets.

Most of the graphs in the rest of the book are small concise examples.  These should be easy to
type into the program editor, and so are not included here.  Often these graphs use data from
the SASHELP library.

If some graphs refer to external data, it is assumed to be in the "sgbook" library that 
points to the "C:\" folder.  So, you should unzip the data files to that folder.  If you prefer
to unzip the files to some other folder, just point the "sgbook" libref to this new location.

The graphs in the book are all rendered using a grey scale style.  The same graphs included
in the samples are rendered using the default color styles for LISTING or HTML.
